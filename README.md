# Bird-Hunting-Game
1.INTRODUCTION:
This is a simple Game that user should click on the picture(GIF) that  appear on the screen and gain points before times over.

4.How Does it Works:
This game is basically getting points with click the picture. In that 
game there are 3 mode easy, Medium, Hard I will explain these modes 
after. First, we have 10 pictures in game if you level up picture 
going to be change, your area (window) as well is going to be bigger 
in every level. You can find increasing information below text.
Also, each click equals to 1 point and you have to reach win point in 
30 or 40 second win point is chosen by randomly between 35 and 40 but 
we have a good news for you in every 10 point you got 3,4,5 second 
more it depends on your score you can find information below.
0 level – 1025, 600
1 Level – 1050, 610
2 Level – 1075, 615
3 Level – 1100, 620
4 Level – 1125, 625
5 Level – 1150, 630
Now we can talk about game modes and time interval. As I mentioned 
that we have 3 game mode. Easy, Medium, Hard. First let’s talk about 
easy game mode it is the easiest game you’ve ever seen because time 
interval is 900 Millisecond so picture move once per 900 millisecond 
you have 30 second and game will notify you what is your win score 
(p.s 36 Point) and you must get that score in 30 minute and don’t 
forget game will give you extra seconds each 10 points.
Medium mode. It is not hard but also not difficult you can do it do 
not worry. In that game time interval is 700 millisecond per movement
and you have again 30 Second just got point and increase your Time.
Hard Mode. It is really hard believe me, even I won that game once 
that is why if you trust yourself then welcome. Time interval is 500 
millisecond per movement. Limit of time is 40 second again time extras 
are available in that mode.

Good Luck.
